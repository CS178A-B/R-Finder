## Overview
Currently, for some existing web apps for faculty to post jobs and students to apply for jobs, students get overwhelmed by all on-campus and off-campus jobs on the UI page.

In order to be more concentrated on connecting students with faculties members who are seeking undergraduate readers and research assistants. Our app pushes notifications of available applicants to faculties, so they get notified and not missed out. Studentsâ€™ GPA, courses taken with good grades, preferred course to do reader or research, etc. are listed on students' profiles as well to help faculties to verify and pick. The web also recommends most matched students to faculties as a reference.

It is a good bridge between faculty members and students, which provides opportunities to those excellent and eligible students and faculty members who need to hire students.
